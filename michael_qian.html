      <h1> Minecraft invented </h1>
      <h3> Minecraft was invented by Markus Persson, also known as "Notch," and the first version of the game, called "Minecraft Classic," was released on May 17, 2009. Inspired by games like Infiniminer, Dwarf Fortress, and Dungeon Keeper, Notch developed Minecraft as a sandbox game that emphasized creativity, exploration, and survival. Initially written in Java, the game allowed players to build and explore blocky, procedurally generated worlds. <h2>

        <h1> GAINING POPULARITY </h1>
          <h3>Minecraft began gaining significant popularity in 2010, during its alpha and beta phases, as word-of-mouth spread through online communities, gaming forums, and YouTube. Early adopters were drawn to its open-ended gameplay, creativity, and the ability to build and explore in a procedurally generated blocky world. The game's unique charm attracted players who enjoyed sandbox-style games, and its multiplayer mode helped communities form around servers.</h3>
